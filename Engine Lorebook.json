A world of magic, mythical creatures, dungeons, guilds, reminiscent of anime isekai stories.\nAnime and manga become reality in this new world. Characters have big eyes, tiny noses, and small lips **exactly like anime characters do**.\nThe protagonist arrives in another world through any typical isekai mechanism\n(e.g., reincarnation, teleportation, summoning, curse, artifact activation, VR entrapment, etc.).\n\n## EXAMPLE ANIME (INSPIRATION ONLY)\nUse the following titles only as thematic references, NOT as templates to copy:\n- Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime)\n- The Rising of the Shield Hero\n- The Eminence in Shadow\n- Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation\n- Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy\n\n## ISEKAI TROPES & ELEMENTS (REQUIRED)\nThe world you generate must include:\n- **Multiple kingdoms or factions** with distinct cultures, politics, conflicts, and agendas.\n- **Magic systems, classes, skills, and abilities**.\n- **A variety of races**, both common (humans, elves, dwarves, beastfolk, demons, spirits)\n  and newly invented races unique to this world.\n- **Adventurer guilds** with quest boards, ranks, and structured guild systems.\n- **Dungeons, ruins, labyrinths, ancient structures**, and **magical zones** that may bend or break normal rules.\n- **Mythical creatures**, both classic and original.\n- A **technology level** typical of fantasy worlds (medieval → early industrial).\n- **Gods, Demon Lords, Vampires**, and other beings who transcend mortal limits.\n  These higher beings are aware of \"otherworlders\" as anomalies—subjects to test, manipulate, or eliminate.\n- Romance tropes as natural possibilities: harems, love triangles, polygamy — but only when **earned through interaction**, never forced or instant.\n- All fantasy-staples: magic, artifacts, **sentient weapons**, weapons who possess their wielders, etc.\n\n## ADVENTURER'S GUILD - RANK SYSTEM\nIron — Entry level. New adventurers, unproven. Limited to non-combat work, simple errands, manual labor, low-risk tasks. Probationary period applies.\nBronze — Proven basics. Can handle minor threats: small beast packs, bandits (1-3), simple escorts, low-danger dungeon floors. Still expected to work in groups for anything serious.\nSilver — Professional. Competent solo operators or reliable team members. Mid-tier monsters, organized bandit groups (4-8), moderate dungeon depths, escort through dangerous territory.\nGold — Elite. Trusted with high-stakes contracts. Powerful monsters, large-scale threats, politically sensitive missions, deep dungeon expeditions.\nPlatinum — Legendary. Kingdom-level threats, demon incursions, dragon hunts, missions that shape history. Rare. Most guilds have only a handful.\n</adventure-setting>","constant":true,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"outletName":"","group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"triggers":[],"displayIndex":0},"1":{"uid":1,"key":[],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"CURRENCY  & ECONOMY","content":"<currency>\n## 💰 CURRENCY\n\n**Silver (sv)** - Universal currency.
